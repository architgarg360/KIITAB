# Online E-book Library (KIITAB)

This project aims at providing books to the students in the form of an e-book.
Books are organised on the basis of categories.
New categories as well as books can be added as required.
Please note this is only a sample and all download links lead to nothing.
For this to work, the download links need to be added beforehand.
As of now all the download links are either dead or lead to File Not Found error.
